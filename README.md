##### Introduction

##### Basic Working Flow of the Proxy Server:

##### How did we implement Multi-threading?
- Used Semaphore instead of Condition Variables and pthread_join() and pthread_exit() function. 
- pthread_join() requires us to pass the thread id of the the thread to wait for. 
- Semaphore’s sem_wait() and sem_post() doesn’t need any parameter. So it is a better option. 


##### Motivation/Need of Project
- To Understand → 
  - The working of requests from our local computer to the server.
  - The handling of multiple client requests from various clients.
  - Locking procedure for concurrency.
  - The concept of cache and its different functions that might be used by browsers.
- Proxy Server do → 
  - It speeds up the process and reduces the traffic on the server side.
  - It can be used to restrict user from accessing specific websites.
  - A good proxy will change the IP such that the server wouldn’t know about the client who sent the request.
  - Changes can be made in Proxy to encrypt the requests, to stop anyone accessing the request illegally from your client.
 
##### OS Component Used ​
- Threading
- Locks 
- Semaphore
- Cache (LRU algorithm is used in it)

##### Access Control (Firewall)
- We implemented a blocklist feature that restricts users from accessing specific websites.
- A `blocklist.txt` file is loaded into memory when the server starts. Any HTTP request for a domain listed in this file is intercepted, and the proxy directly responds with a `403 Forbidden` error page.

##### Limitations ​
- If a URL opens multiple clients itself, then our cache will store each client’s response as a separate element in the linked list. So, during retrieval from the cache, only a chunk of response will be send and the website will not open
- Fixed size of cache element, so big websites may not be stored in cache. 

##### How this project can be extended? ​
- This code can be implemented using multiprocessing that can speed up the process with parallelism.
- We can implement requests like POST with this code.


# Note :-
- Code is well commented. For any doubt you can refer to the comments.


## How to Run

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/uddiGitHub/MultiThreadedProxyServerClient.git
$ cd MultiThreadedProxyServerClient
$ make all
$ ./proxy <port no.>
```
**Note:**
- This code can only be run in Linux or MacOS Machine. Please disable your browser cache.
- To run the proxy without cache, change the name of the file in the Makefile (`proxy_server_with_cache.c` to `proxy_server_without_cache.c`).

## Demo
![](https://github.com/uddiGitHub/MultiThreadedProxyServerClient/blob/main/pics/cache.png)

- When website is opened for the first time (`url not found`) then cache will be miss.
- Then if you again open that website again then `Data is retrieved from the cache` will be printed.

| **Uddipta Deka** | [uddiGitHub](https://github.com/uddiGitHub) | Implemented Firewall / Access Control feature: `blocklist.txt` loading, hostname blocking via `is_blocked()` check, and `403 Forbidden` response before request forwarding. Applied to both `proxy_server_with_cache.c` and `proxy_server_without_cache.c`. |
